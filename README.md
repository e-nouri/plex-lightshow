# Plex Lightshow
Sync your hue lights in realtime with Plex Media Server

# How it works
When media playing is detected, the plex server will process the current playing video in realtime to calculate the dominant colour on screen. The program then syncs this with the current time and updates the hue lights accordingly.

# Tests
For our tests we are using BigBuckBunny (4K and 1080p)
